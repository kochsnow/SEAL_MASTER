## What is arxiv dataset.
ArXiv is an open-access repository of electronic preprints. We collect 4666 Computer Science (CS) arXiv papers in- dexed by Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). These papers belong to five subject areas including AI, CL, IT, LG and CV. The arXiv papers data forms a citation network which indicates citation relationship. Each paper consists of two parts: title and abstract. The statistics of the arXiv paper dataset is listed in the following table:

|Class|Number|Length of title|Length of abstract|
|-----|------|---------------|------------------|
|AI.  |232   |8.57.          |158.04            |
|CL.  |648.  |9.25.          |140.36            |
|IT|909|10.12|170.29|
|LG|1157|8.69|160.63|
